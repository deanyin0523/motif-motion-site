  <p>Eva grew up traumatized and alone after witnessing her mother being killed by attackers from the Black Diamond Pack. Her fiancé Jacob also joined everyone in isolating her. When Eva turned 18, she finally got her own wolf. Met the extremely charming Silas in the forest. To Eva's surprise, Silas then transformed into human form, becoming Lycaon himself, King of Arcadia and ruler of all werewolves. He wants her to become his queen and rule the werewolf kingdom together. Silas appears to have a very dark past and many enemies, which worries Eva, leaving her unsure if she can be his partner or fit into his dangerous world. Silas tries to reassure her that he loves her and would never let her come to any harm, explaining that Eva is actually a very rare wolf with special powers. He says he has more to tell her, but she must come with him to Arcadia. After careful consideration, Eva decides to give Silas a chance to prove himself and travels with him to his kingdom. During their long and dangerous journey together, they encountered many difficulties and dangers. After arriving in the Kingdom of Arcadia, Silas reveals to Eva that she is actually a werewolf goddess with incredible powers that are only beginning to blossom. Silas explains how only together they can rule the werewolves and banish the evil Black Diamonds forever, bringing peace to the kingdom. Can Eva trust Silas? Will they blend in and live happily ever after?</p>
